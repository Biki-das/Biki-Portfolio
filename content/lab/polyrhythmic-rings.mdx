In the pursuit of bringing my ideas to life and continuing to grow my front-end skills, my next step was to explore Scalable Vector Graphics.

Inpired by <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed" target="_blank" aria-label="hyperplexed's youtube channel">Hyperplexed's</Link> video on Youtube, I built a similar experience, using SVGs instead of his approach that used an HTML Canvas.

In an attempt to explore beyond the grayscale pallete I generally enjoy, I used a color wheel as the background for the rings. This allowed me to add a subtle pop of color to the visuals of the animation.

<MDXVideo
  src="/lab/polyrhythmic-rings/videos/rings.mp4"
  alt="color wheel svg being used as a shared stroke for the rings"
  width={540}
  height={540}
/>

With React managing the state and Framer Motion handling the smooth transitions, my main focus was to visualize the calming sounds through a familiar medium like strings. More specifically, <Tooltip text="Stringed musical instruments.">chordophones</Tooltip>.

<MDXVideo
  src="/lab/polyrhythmic-rings/videos/strings.mp4"
  alt="the strings getting distorted by the filter"
  width={1262}
  height={540}
/>

Each chords is an SVG `<Line />` with a filter that uses an `<feTurbulence />` and an `<feDisplacementMap />` that is triggered when the white circles, lets call them "beads", hit the strings.

```jsx title="jsx"
<feTurbulence
  type="fractalNoise"
  baseFrequency={baseFrequencyByIndex}
  numOctaves="1"
  result="warp"
  colorInterpolationFilters="sRGB"
/>
<feDisplacementMap
  xChannelSelector="R"
  yChannelSelector="G"
  scale="0"
  in="SourceGraphic"
  in2="warp"
  colorInterpolationFilters="sRGB"
>
  <animate
    attributeName="scale"
    values="0; 8; 4; 0;"
    dur=".4s"
    begin=".1s"
    colorInterpolationFilters="sRGB"
  />
</feDisplacementMap>
```

The user sees that when a bead hits a string, it causes the string to vibrate. The code however, works by simply triggering the filter everytime the bead's rotation value touches a multiple of `180Â°`.

Moreover, instead of calculating the position of the beads for both the `x` and `y` coordinates, I chose a simpler and more manageable approach of setting the origin of transform for the beads to the center of the SVG and rotating them around that center.

The most challenging part of the project was improving performance and dealing with cross-browser compatibility. Despite the major improvements I made over the course of the project's development through bug fixing, rewriting components, and rigorous testing, I felt the need to provide a <Tooltip text="A mechanism used to shut down or disable a device or program.">killswitch</Tooltip> that allows the user to disable some of the performance heavy animations.

I will be exploring Scalable Vector Graphics a lot more in the future, and as I've recently gotten a taste for GLSL shaders as well, the possibilities are endless.

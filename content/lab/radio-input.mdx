One of the most unexplored form inputs in UI design is the radio input. Why limit ourselves to simple circles and a dot? So here's an elegant, sleek, and modern radio input. My love for grayscale, glares, and gradients is evident in this design.

One of the creative challenges I faced was building the background pattern. The effect starts with a dot pattern made using a `<circle />` element.

```jsx
<pattern
  id="dots-pattern"
  width="20"
  height="20"
  patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse"
>
  <circle cx="1" cy="1" r="1" fill="white" />
</pattern>
<mask id="mask-dots">
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#dots-pattern)" />
</mask>
```

We then build a `<linearGradient />` who's `stop-color` values are manipulated using Framer Motion based on the selected option.

```jsx
const motionTransition = {
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 75,
  damping: 25,
};
<linearGradient id="linear-gradient" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="0%" y2="100%">
  <motion.stop
    stopColor="rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.06125)"
    initial={false}
    animate={{
      offset: gradientTop - gradientHeight + "%",
    }}
    transition={motionTransition}
  />
  <motion.stop
    stopColor="rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.5)"
    initial={false}
    animate={{
      offset: gradientTop + "%",
    }}
    transition={motionTransition}
  />
  <motion.stop
    stopColor="rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.06125)"
    initial={false}
    animate={{
      offset: gradientTop + gradientHeight + "%",
    }}
    transition={motionTransition}
  />
</linearGradient>;
```

Putting them together, we create a `<mask />` using these two to make the dots brighter when the linear gradient's position is near them. It works by making parts of the `<rect />` be transparent where the "dots pattern" is black. The remaining parts are the white dots themselves, which show the linear gradient behind them being used as a fill.

```jsx
<mask id="mask-dots-on-linear">
  <rect
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    fill="url(#linear-gradient)"
    mask="url(#mask-dots)"
  />
</mask>
```

<MDXImage
  src="/lab/radio-input/images/dots-linear-comparison.png"
  alt="combining the dots pattern and the linear gradient"
  width={1087}
  height={721}
  wrapperClassName="!mt-2"
/>

While this by itself achives the effect we were going for, the finishing touch comes with the use of a `<radialGradient />` on which the mask will be used over. This gives the highlighted area a more organic and dynamic shape, giving off the impression of a light source.

```jsx
<radialGradient
  id="radial-gradient"
  cx="50%"
  cy="50%"
  r="40%"
  fx="50%"
  fy="50%"
>
  <stop offset="0%" stopColor="white" />
  <stop offset="100%" stopColor="rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.125)" />
</radialGradient>
```

And now we finally apply the radial gradient as a `fill` to our main `<rect />`, and use the mask we created earlier, to achieve the final effect.

```jsx
<rect
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  fill="url(#radial-gradient)"
  mask="url(#mask-dots-on-linear)"
/>
```

<MDXImage
  src="/lab/radio-input/images/dots-linear-radial-comparison.png"
  alt="combining our effect and the radial gradient"
  width={1086}
  height={720}
  wrapperClassName="mt-2"
/>

There's something beautiful about exploring unchartered territories, even for something as simple as a radio input. It's a reminder that there's always opportunities to innovate and create something new.
